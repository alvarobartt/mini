`mini` is a collection of mini scripts, notebooks, projects, and more. Note that everything
included in this repository has been created for educational-purposes only, not for production
use-cases.

## What kind of projects?

It depends on what I'm interested in at the moment. Lately, most of the projects have been
related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), but I'm also interested in Computer Vision (CV), and
MLOps in general.

## What programming languages?

Mainly Python, eventually Rust.

## What's considered "mini"?

Anything that can be done in a few hours, or a few days at most. I'm not looking to create
production-ready code, but rather to learn new things and have fun.
